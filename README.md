## Implementing Enigma

### Some pecularities of the Enigma

1. When a key is pressed the rotors move first and then the cipher letter lights up.
1. The fast rotor was always moved one position when each keystroke was made. On this rotor was a notch that when it got into a certain position would cause the middle rotor to be advanced one position. The middle rotor also had a notch that would cause the slow rotor to be advanced, but it would also advance the middle rotor as well. This is known as double stepping.
1. The rotor wirings and notches are fixed relative to each other. But the ring settings can be changed. The ring settings offset the letters relative to the internal wiring and notches
